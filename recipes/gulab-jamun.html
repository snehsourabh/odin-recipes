        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gulab jamun is a sweet confectionary or dessert, originating<br>
            in the Indian subcontinent and a type of mithai popular in <br>
            India, Pakistan, Nepal, the Maldives (where it is known as <br>
            gulab ki janu), and Bangladesh, as well as Myanmar. It is <br>
            made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which<br>
            is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern <br>
            recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It <br>
            is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews<br>
            to enhance flavour.</p>
