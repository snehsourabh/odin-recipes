# odin-recipes
This repository consists of the code for creating a HTML website for 
finding a few recipes. The webiste has one webpage which contains a 
list of recipes and the links to other webapges having detailed recipes.

This project will only use the basic HTML tags such as <p>, <a>, <img>
etc. The website created won't look very pretty, but it is necessary to
get a hang of building webistes with HTML.
